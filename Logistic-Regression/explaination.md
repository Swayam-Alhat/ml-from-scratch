# Explanation of Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is ML algorithm used for classification. Unlike linear regression which predicts continuous values it predicts the probability that an input belongs to a specific class.

Example, to predict if email is spam or not spam.

To know more about logistic regression, Read article from IBM on [Logistic Regression](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/logistic-regression)

_Since, probability lies between 0 and 1. we need to calculate value of y (target variable) which lies within 0 and 1._

Thus, we use **sigmoid function** which outputs value between 0 and 1. Sigmoid function is also known as Logistic function.

**_To understand why sigmoid function is used and how it works_**, have a look at [Why sigmoid? →](../intuition/sigmoid.md)

## How Logistic Regression algorithm learns

Since we know logistic regression is used for classification, it calculates probability of whether given input `x` belongs to class 1 or not.

_So we need a function which outputs value between 0 and 1.  
(since probability is between 0 and 1_)

linear function `y =  mx + b` outputs value between −∞ to ∞. So we need a function which transforms it into value which is between 0 and 1

**Sigmoid does it**

Standard formula of sigmoid -

$`σ(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}`$

where, $`z`$ is linear prediction. Meaning predicted value using `z =  mx + b`

So, basically, $`z`$ is output of `mx + b`

So we can say,  
$`z`$ = $`mx + b`$

where `m` is weight and `b` is bias`

let $`z`$ be the predicted value using linear function $`z`$ = $`mx + b`$

So, initially, It does the same as linear regression does.

Calculates $`z`$ using linear function $`z`$ = $`mx + b`$

Then apply Sigmoid function on it

σ ($`z`$) = $`\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}`$

After calculating, we get value of σ($`z`$) which is between 0 and 1. **This is estimated probability**.

Let $`y_p`$ be the estimated probability

So, σ($`z`$) = $`y_p`$

Now, we compare $`y`$ (actual value) and $`y_p`$ (predicted value)

- If $`y`$ is 1 and $`y_p`$ is close to 1, we say our prediction is **correct**.

- If $`y`$ is 0 and $`y_p`$ is close to 0, we say our prediction is **correct**.
- If $`y`$ is 1 and $`y_p`$ is close to 0, we say our prediction is **incorrect**.
- If $`y`$ is 0 and $`y_p`$ is close to 1, we say our prediction is **incorrect**.

_Correct prediction means current values of `m` and `b` are optimal._

_Incorrect prediction means current values of `m` and `b` are not optimal_

**Now, $`y_p`$ is predicted value for current values of m and b (weights and bias)**

#### But, to find the optimal values of `m` and `b`, we need a function/equation that tells the likelihood that current weights and bias are optimal.

Here comes Likelihood formula -

$`L(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} [y_p]^{y} . [1 - y_p]^{1 - y}`$

where,  
$`L(\theta)`$ - means Likelihood of current parameters (weights and bias) to be optimal

$`\prod_{i=1}^{n}`$ - means product of all data points. Meaning perform $`[y_p]^{y} . [1 - y_p]^{1 - y}`$ for each data points and then multiply all of them to get single value of likelihood

$`[y_p]^{y} . [1 - y_p]^{1 - y}`$ - This operation gives $`L(\theta)`$ (likelihood of current parameters to be optimal) for a single data point.  
\*We perform this operation for each data point and take product of the all resulted values to get single **global likelihood of current parameters of being optimal\***

$`L(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} [y_p]^{y} . [1 - y_p]^{1 - y}`$

This likelihood function outputs -

- value close to 1, if prediction $`y_p`$ matches or close to actual true value $`y`$
- value close to 0, if prediction $`y_p`$ is _NOT_ close to actual true value $`y`$

Example,

**Case 1** - When prediction is close to actual value, meaning , **prediction is correct**

> $`y_p`$ is sigmoid output

Let,  
prediction $`y_p`$ = 0.999  
Actual true value $`y`$ = 1

> As _prediction_ is close to _actual value_, we get to know that for this data point, **m** and **b** (parameters) are optimal.  
> Lets check it by using _Likelihood function_

> $`L(\theta) =  [y_p]^{y} . [1 - y_p]^{1 - y}`$

> This above likelihood formula is for single data point

```console
>>> 0.999**1 * (1 - 0.999)**0
0.999
```

So, when prediction $`y_p`$ is close to actual value $`y`$, meaning, prediction is accurate, then $`L(\theta)`$ outputs value close to 1, indicating current parameters (m and b) are optimal.

**Case 2** - When prediction is _NOT_ close to actual value, meaning , **prediction is incorrect**

Let,  
prediction $`y_p`$ = 0.999  
Actual true value $`y`$ = 0

> Here, actual true value $`y`$ is 0 and prediction $`y_p`$ is 0.999 (almost close to 1). **So the prediction is incorrect**

```console
>>> 0.999**0 * (1 - 0.999)**1
0.0010000000000000009
```

So, $`L(\theta)`$ is close to 0, indicating current values of m and b are not optimal

So, likelihood $`L(\theta)`$ represents if current parameters (m and b) are optimal.

- If $`L(\theta)`$ outputs value close to 1, meaning prediction is accurate, then current parameters (m and b) are optimal

* If $`L(\theta)`$ outputs value close to 0, meaning prediction is _NOT_ accurate, then current parameters (m and b) are _NOT_ optimal

> Algorithm calculates likelihood for each data points, then take product of all of them to get **_global Likelhood estimate_**

### But

This formula has some flaws -

- Numerical underflow (multiplying hundreds of tiny probabilities together approaches zero and breaks floating point)  
  **_solution - Take Logarithm of whole function_**

- We want to apply gradient descent for optimization and gradient descent minimizes. (But here we want to maximize, meaning if $`L(\theta)`$ is 0.002 which is close to 0 then we want to maximize it to 1 )  
  **_solution - multiply with_** $`(-1)`$

- As we apply Logarithm, **product** converts into **sum**.  
  **_solution - divide it by n (total number of data points)_**  
  **_Multiply with_** $`\frac{1}{n}`$

> [!NOTE]  
> Read about gradient descent from Gradient-descent.md file

Applying above mentioned changes

log($`L(\theta)`$) = $`\sum_{i=1}^{n}`$ $` log ([y_p]^{y} . [1 - y_p]^{1 - y})`$

since
$`log(a,b) = log(a) + log(b)`$

log($`L(\theta)`$) = $`\sum_{i=1}^{n}`$ $`log([y_p]^{y}) + log([1 - y_p]^{1 - y})`$

since  
$`log(a^{b}) = b . log(a) `$

log($`L(\theta)`$) = $`\sum_{i=1}^{n}`$ $`y . log(y_p) + (1 - y) . log(1 - y_p)`$

Now , we multiply it with $`\frac{-1}{n}`$

log($`L(\theta)`$) = $` \frac{-1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} y . log(y_p) + (1 - y) . log(1 - y_p)`$

**_we get_**,

> $`J(\theta) =  \frac{-1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} [y . log(y_p) + (1 - y) . log(1 - y_p)]`$

#### This is Cross Entropy loss function

**_This is what we minimizes using gradient descent_**

> [!NOTE]  
> Basically, we **_maximize_** the function as we want the value close to **1**, but **_gradient descent_** formula is fixed and it always **_minimizes_**. Thats why, we flipped function curve by negating it (**_multiplied with -1_**). So. now we use original gradient descent (which minimizes) but as we flipped the sides, we are actually maximizing the function  
> Read about gradient descent from Gradient-descent.md file

#### Here comes Gradient descent which allows us to minimize the function

**_So after calculating partial derivative of cross entropy w.r.t $`\theta`$ (single parameter), we get_**

$$\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} ( y_p - y) x$$

So, **this is the formula for gradient calculation**

> [!NOTE]  
> Gradient formula for cross entropy of b (bias), is same except multiplication with $`x`$  
> $$\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} ( y_p - y)$$

then, we update parameter $`\theta`$

$$\theta_{new} = \theta - \alpha \frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta}$$

**This is the update formula**

here,

- $`\theta_{new}`$ is new value of parameter
- $`\theta`$ is old value of parameter

* $`\alpha`$ is Learning rate (step size)

* $`\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta}`$ is Gradient of the cost function $`j(\theta)`$ with respect to $`\theta`$
* $`-`$ Indicates moving in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the function

### Steps algorithm follow to learn (find optimal parameters)

1. Initialize parameters (m and b) with zero

2. predict output using Sigmoid function

3. Calculate loss using cross entropy loss function

4. Calculate gradient of loss function using gradient formula and then update parameters (m and b) using update formula

5. Again repeat from step 1 until loss calculated using loss function is unchanged or changes slightly  
   (**_At this point, we get optimal values of m and b which are used for prediction on new unseen data_**)
